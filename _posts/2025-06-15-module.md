# Module

## Introduction to Modules

In Drupal, modules are the building blocks that make up the core functionality of your website. They contain PHP code that provides additional features or controls particular functions of your Drupal project. A number of modules come with Drupal out of the box; however, developers can create their own to meet unique requirements. Modules are one of the key aspects that provide Drupal its flexibility, scalability, and customization possibilities.

Modules in Drupal can serve a broad range of functions. For instance, user registration, navigation menu management, basic website page layout, managing URL pathways, and more basic features are all built into Drupal native modules. On the other hand, more advanced features such as ecommerce, photo galleries, and forums can either be added by third party modules or custom created by the developer.

## Writing a Custom Module

To start creating a module, you need a `.info` file and a `.module` file. Let’s start with a basic example of a `hello_world` module.

Firstly, you'll need to create the info file `hello_world.info`:

```php
name = Hello World
description = A module that says Hello World
core = 7.x
```

The `.info` file serves as the descriptor for your module. It’s important to note that the `core` value must match the core version of Drupal for which the module is intended.

Next, you'll need to create the `hello_world.module` file:

```php
<?php
function hello_world_menu() {
  $items = array();
  $items['hello-world'] = array(
    'title' => 'Hello world',
    'page callback' => 'hello_world_output',
    'access arguments' => array('access content'),
    'type' => MENU_SUGGESTED_ITEM,
  );
  return $items;
}
function hello_world_output() {
  return 'Hello World!';
}
```

The `hello_world_menu()` function tells Drupal to add a new path `hello-world`, the title of the page would be 'Hello world', and the page content would be delivered by the `hello_world_output()` function.

## Power of Modules

Modules serve as modular plugins that can be used to extend your site's functionality without having to touch the core code. This affords the ability to add or remove features as per project requirements. It also ensures that the core system remains performance optimized, and threat resilient. Essentially, through the proficient use of modules, developers can sculpt Drupal to perfectly fit the administrator’s and end-user's needs.

In conclusion, modules are at the heart of Drupal's flexibility and extendability, making it easy to customize and cater to your specific web needs. Get creative, dive in, and unveil the opportunity to extend Drupal through module development. Your development projects will greatly benefit from the ability to tailor your site to your exact specifications, and the open source community offers a great platform to share your efforts.

## Kernel

In the domain of web development, especially Drupal web development, a 'Kernel' holds a vital role. A Kernel can be best defined as the fundamental component of computing or as the core of any computing system. It acts as a mediator, managing the communication between the software and hardware of the computer. A robust kernel ensures smoother functioning of other processes by efficiently managing the tasks of both hardware resources and software applications.

In a website project, the primary job of a kernel is to control and distribute system resources. It manages different vital tasks like memory, CPU time distribution, disk space, device drivers, and network interfaces. Kernel's responsibility stretches from the basic input/output request operations to complex processes like application scheduling and user privilege control.

In Drupal Development, the Kernel takes in the middleware patterns that involve handling HTTP requests. Here's an example of how you can create a new kernel and send a request through it in Drupal:

```php
$kernel = new DrupalKernel('prod', $autoloader);
$request = Request::createFromGlobals();
$response = $kernel->handle($request);
$response->send();
$kernel->terminate($request, $response);
```
In the given code, a new Drupal kernel is created in the production environment. Then, an HTTP request is generated using the global superglobals array. This request is passed to the handle method, which returns an HTTP response. The response is sent back to the client. The Symfony HTTP Kernel receives the request, turns it into a Drupal request, and calls the appropriate controller.

While coding and development come under the umbrella of practical functions, project management plays a vital part in kernel performance. Proper project management ensures efficient task distribution, reducing overloading, and enhancing performance. 

In conclusion, the Kernel is an integral part of web development, acting as the backbone of the execution process. It connects interface, software, and hardware, and ensures the smooth function of digital operations. Understanding the kernel's responsibilities in operating system architecture, software operations, and project management is thus essential to becoming a prosperous web developer. So, next time you work on a web development project, remember the kernel is not just the heart of your operating system, it's the heart of your whole web development project.

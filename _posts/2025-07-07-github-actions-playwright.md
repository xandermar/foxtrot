post_description: "Explains how to automate testing for Drupal 11 using GitHub Actions and Playwright. It covers setting up a workflow that triggers on updates to the master branch, builds a complete Drupal 11 environment with Docker, installs the site, and runs three sample Playwright end-to-end tests. This automation ensures code quality and site stability after each deployment, streamlining continuous integration for Drupal projects."

# Automated Drupal 11 Testing: CI/CD Superpowers with GitHub Actions & Playwright

Hereâ€™s a **GitHub Actions workflow** that triggers on updates to the `master` branch, spins up a Drupal 11 site using Docker, and then runs three sample [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) tests. This script is meant to be run **in your repository root as `.github/workflows/drupal11-playwright.yml`**.

**Assumptions:**

* You have a standard Drupal 11 codebase (composer-based).
* You have a `tests/playwright` directory with your Playwright test scripts.
* You want to run three sample Playwright tests (you can swap the file names as needed).

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: |
          cd tests/playwright

### **How it works:**

1. **Triggers** when `master` branch is updated.
2. **Spins up MySQL** as a service.
3. **Installs PHP/Composer/Drush** and sets up Drupal 11.
4. **Runs Drupal site** using Docker (official Drupal 11 image).
5. **Performs Drupal site install** with Drush.
6. **Checks the site** is responding at `http://localhost:8080/`.
7. **Installs Node.js & Playwright**.
8. **Runs 3 Playwright tests** from `tests/playwright`.

### **What you need to provide:**

* Place your Playwright tests in `tests/playwright/` (e.g., `test1.spec.ts`, `test2.spec.ts`, `test3.spec.ts`).
* Your repo should have a valid `composer.json` and `package.json` in the Playwright directory.

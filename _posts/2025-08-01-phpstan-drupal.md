## Phpstan-drupal

In the complex and multifarious world of Drupal development, tools easing the development process are always welcome. One such instrument, Phpstan-drupal, an extension of PHPStan specifically designed for Drupal, has emerged as an essential aid for developers. PHPStan, a static analysis tool for Php, is an open-source project maintained by Ondřej Mirtes. This software scrutinizes your codebase for errors, thus promoting quality assurance and facilitating efficient coding. With Phpstan-drupal, this technology has been tailored to meet the needs of Drupal developers.

Drupal, a PHP-based content management system (CMS), is a sophisticated platform supporting an array of features for developers and end-users. However, this complexity in functionality can leave room for development errors. That's where Phpstan-drupal comes in. This extension enhances PHPStan by providing understanding of Drupal's unique traits. With partial understanding of Hook implementations, Table Select, Configuration and Entity APIs, it moves ahead of the standard PHP static analysis tools.

Installing Phpstan-drupal is a simple process. It’s ready to use with Composer, a popular dependency manager in PHP. To install with Composer, use the following command:

```shell
composer require --dev mglaman/phpstan-drupal
```

Running the static analysis for Phpstan-drupal is equally straightforward. This can be done using the following command:

```shell
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -l max -c phpstan.neon web/modules/custom
```

The snippet above allows analysis of custom modules available in a Drupal project. "-l max" is used to set the maximum level of rules. The "-c phpstan.neon" flag specifies an optional configuration file.

Besides these functionalities, one of the most powerful features of Phpstan-drupal is its extensibility. It welcomes further extensions that aim to augment its functionality. For instance, the PHPStan-deprecation-rules extension, which can be integrated by using "mglaman/phpstan-drupal-deprecations" command in the Composer, red-flags any usage of deprecated codes in your codebase, which is particularly useful when migrating from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9.

```shell
composer require --dev mglaman/phpstan-drupal-deprecations
```

In conclusion, Phpstan-drupal is a robust tool for Drupal developers intending to improve code quality, ensure consistent coding styles, and minimize errors. It provides an automated way of inspecting Drupal codes ma them more reliable and maintainable. Certainly, it is a development asset worth incorporating into your Drupal project.

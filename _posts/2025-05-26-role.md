## Role

Web development, design, and website project management are distinct roles that culminate in the creation of a web product. Web development involves the coding and programming that enable the website to function. The responsibilities of this role include the build of the website framework, the creation of the site layout, and the coding of the site. Web developers work with programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create customizable, responsive, and interactive websites.

Web design, on the other hand, is heavily focused on the aesthetics and user interface of a website. It's the job of a web designer to make a website visually appealing and user-friendly. They create graphics, design layouts, choose color schemes, select fonts, and determine the navigation scheme that provides the most effective user experience. Web designers don't just consider the appearance of the site; they also take into account its usability and overall user experience.

Website project management forms the backbone of a web creation project. The project manager is accountable for planning, all types of coordination, resource allocation, and delivery within a set timeline and budget. From gathering requirements and managing web design to overseeing coding tasks and conducting quality assurance, a project manager ensures all parts of the web project come together seamlessly.

To be considered successful, a website project needs strong performing roles in web development, design, and project management. Developers bring the technical skills to build the site, designers make it visually appealing and user-friendly and project managers keep the project running smoothly, within budget, and on time. Each role has its own set of skills and responsibilities, but they all work together to deliver a stellar product.

While each role is unique and plays its part in the overall delivery of the website, they are intertwined. Web developers and designers need to collaborate to ensure that the design of the website can be implemented effectively without compromising the functionality and responsiveness of the site. Similarly, website project managers have to work closely with designers and developers to understand what is possible within the set timeline and budget and communicate effectively to stakeholders.

In conclusion, the roles of web development, design, and project management are integral to any website project. Although each role has its distinct functions, they must interact effectively with each other to create a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly website that meets the client's requirements and deadline. Understanding these roles and how they complement each other is crucial for anyone entering the world of web development, design, or project management.

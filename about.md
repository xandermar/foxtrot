### And So It Began…

Xandermar was founded in 2010. We are a small business that caters to website development. We focus on websites, plain and simple. From drafting, branding and planning to multi-platform production, we deliver engaging and functional websites to our clients both small business and large Enterprise agencies.

Our platform focus packages are Drupal and WordPress. We consult agencies with these platforms plus continuous integration, containerization, and full deployment schema. All of our systems are deployed using Apache lamp stack whether standard architecture or containerized architecture.

Our containerized architecture can be either custom or integrated with other architectural platforms such as Amazon or Acquia.

### Why the turtle?

Xandermar’s concept began on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. While sitting on the beach at Turtle Bay Resort on the Oahu’s north shore, we spotted a sea turtle swimming about. We learned that sea turtles can live over 100 years and they’re really good at survival in rough environments. Besides being an adorable creature, they teach us about calm, cool and collected vibes. As Crush (Disney’s “Finding Nemo” character) would say, “Totally!”

### Why the slogan?

The slogan, “Knowledge is power, enthusiasm pulls the switch” comes from Libby Gibson. She had the quote on her refrigerator for years, and still does to this day. Every time there was a question of what to do next, she’d point at the slogan. The slogan has always inspired Xandermar to do more. Doing more is equally paired with enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, the knowledge may be never utilized or never maximized to its potential. Alternatively, we can have all the enthusiasm in the world, but without educating ourselves it doesn’t matter. For knowledge is the engine that moves the train forward, the key to start the engine will be nothing other than enthusiasm.
